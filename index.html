        <p>
          In 1977, Stallone was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for
          two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor.
          Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 1982, Stallone's films were not big box-office successes
          unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim
          achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action
          film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John
          Rambo.
